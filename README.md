# ParkingLot
Good Day,

Thank you for the opportunity.
As per the instruction i have solved the assignment

1. I have optimized the given code.
    (In program.cs - insted of executing one by one statement i used for loop and execute statements at a time)
2. To make it code more testable i have added 'TestParkingLot' (Unit Test Project) to the current project.
    and write TestMethod for each statement.
3. Possible test cases for ParkingLotManager application has been attached
